Which Project to Pick?(http://mindprod.com/projects/projects.html)
People often write me and ask “Which project should I pick?” as if I knew their hearts and abilities. Here is a strategy. First narrow down the choices to the ones that look about your level of difficulty. Then narrow down the ones to your interest in financial potential. Then narrow down projects to ones that involve servers or do not. Now weed out ones that look boring or esoteric to you. Now look for the project with most heart. Do you care about the result? You will need to care in the times ahead when the hard work comes of implementing, documenting, researching, and futzing about to get it to work. For children, video games are the usual choice. For adults, it can be anything. Further, you don't have to pick one of my projects. Let one of mine inspire you to create one your own. Think in terms of your own interests and hobbies. What would be useful? Think about the frustrations you have had with software. What sort of better mousetrap does the world need?
